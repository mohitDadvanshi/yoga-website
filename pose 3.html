<b>Starting Position:<br></b>

Begin in a standing position at the top of your mat, with your feet together and your arms at your sides.<br>
<b>Step Back:<br></b>

Take a step back with your right foot, keeping your left foot forward. The distance between your feet should be about the length of one of your own legs.<br>
<b>Foot and Hip Alignment:<br></b>

Turn your right foot to a 90-degree angle, so the outer edge of your right foot is parallel with the back edge of your mat. Your left foot should be pointing directly forward. Align your left heel with the arch of your right foot.<br>
<b>Bend the Front Knee:<br></b>

Bend your left knee, bringing it directly over your left ankle. Aim for a 90-degree angle in the left knee, but make sure it feels comfortable and does not go past your ankle.<br>
<b>Leg Position:<br></b>

Ground down through the outer edge of your back foot, pressing it firmly into the mat. Your back leg should be straight, with a slight external rotation.<br>
<b>Torso Upright:<br></b>

Lift your torso upright and extend your arms parallel to the floor, reaching them actively out to the sides. Your shoulders should be directly over your hips.<br>
<b>Gaze:<br></b>

Look over your left fingertips, keeping your gaze focused and steady.<br>
<b>Shoulder Position:<br></b>

Relax your shoulders away from your ears and engage your core muscles to stabilize your torso.<br>
<b>Hold the Pose:<br></b>

Hold Warrior 2 for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply and maintaining a steady focus.<br>
<b>Transitioning Out:<br></b>

To release the pose, straighten your left leg, lower your arms, and step your right foot forward to return to the starting position.<br>
<b>Repeat on the Other Side:<br></b>

Repeat the sequence with your right foot forward and left foot back to balance the pose on both sides.<br><center>
