<b>Starting Position:<br></b>

Begin by standing at the front of your mat with your feet together. Your heels should touch, and your toes can be slightly apart if it's more comfortable.<br>
<b>Weight Distribution:<br></b>

Distribute your weight evenly across both feet. Feel the connection of your feet with the ground.<br>
<b>Alignment:<br></b>

Engage your thigh muscles and lift your kneecaps without locking your knees. This action helps to activate the muscles in your legs.<br>
<b>Pelvic Alignment:<br></b>

Tuck your tailbone slightly to lengthen the spine. Ensure that your pelvis is in a neutral position.<br>
<b>Core Engagement:<br></b>

Engage your abdominal muscles by drawing your navel in toward your spine. This helps to support your lower back.<br>
<b>Shoulder Position:<br></b>

Roll your shoulders back and down, opening your chest. Let your arms hang by your sides with your palms facing forward.<br>
<b>Neck and Head Alignment:<br></b>

Lengthen your neck by lifting the crown of your head toward the ceiling. Keep your chin parallel to the floor.<br>
<b>Arm Position:<br></b>

Allow your arms to relax by your sides or, if you prefer, bring your palms together in front of your chest in a prayer position (Anjali Mudra).<br>
<b>Gaze:<br></b>

Soften your gaze, looking straight ahead. Focus on a point in front of you to help with balance.<br>
<b>Breathing:<br></b>

Take deep, slow breaths. Inhale through your nose, expanding your chest and abdomen, and exhale through your nose or mouth.<br>
<b>Mindfulness:<br></b>

Stand tall and grounded, cultivating a sense of strength and stability. Feel the connection between your body and the Earth.<br>
<b>Hold the Pose:<br></b>

Stay in the Mountain Pose for 30 seconds to a minute, or as long as is comfortable for you.<br><center>
