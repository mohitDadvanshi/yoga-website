<b>Starting Position:<br></b>

Begin in a standing position, with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Find a point of focus, preferably at eye level, to help with balance.<br>
<b>Weight Distribution:<br></b>

Shift your weight onto your left foot, grounding it firmly into the mat.<br>
<b>Lift the Right Leg:<br></b>

Lift your right foot off the floor and place the sole of your right foot against the inner left thigh. Avoid placing the foot directly on the knee joint to prevent strain.<br>
<b>Foot Placement Options:<br></b>

<b>Choose one of the following foot placements:<br></b>
Place the sole of the foot against the inner calf (avoiding the knee).
For a more advanced variation, you can bring the foot higher, placing it against the inner thigh.<br>
<b>Hands Position:<br></b>

Bring your palms together in front of your chest in a prayer position (Anjali Mudra).<br>
<b>Engage the Core:<br></b>

Engage your core muscles to help with balance and stability.<br>
<b>Lengthen the Spine:<br></b>

Lengthen your spine, drawing your shoulders down and away from your ears.<br>
<b>Gaze:<br></b>

Find a focal point (a drishti) to help with balance. Look at a spot that is not moving and maintain a soft gaze.<br>
<b>Hold the Pose:<br></b>

Hold Tree Pose for 30 seconds to a minute, or longer if you are comfortable. Focus on your breath and maintain a steady posture.<br>
<b>Transitioning Out:<br></b>

Release the pose by bringing your right foot down to the mat.<br>
<b>Repeat on the Other Side:<br></b>

Shift your weight to your right foot and repeat the steps with your left foot.<br>
<b>Tips:<br></b>

If you're having difficulty balancing, you can place the toes of the lifted foot on the floor for a modified version of the pose.<br>
Avoid pressing the foot into the knee joint to prevent potential injury.<br>
Don't be discouraged if you wobble or lose balance; it's a normal part of the practice.<br><center>
