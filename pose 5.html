<b>Starting Position:<br></b>

Begin in a tabletop position on your hands and knees, with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.<br>
<b>Knee Placement:<br></b>

Bring your big toes together and spread your knees apart, creating space for your torso to fit between your thighs.<br>
<b>Sit Back:<br></b>
Lower your hips back toward your heels, allowing your torso to rest between your thighs. Your forehead can come to the mat.<br>
<b>Arm Extension:<br></b>

Extend your arms forward, reaching your hands out in front of you. Alternatively, you can bring your arms alongside your body with your palms facing up.<br>
<b>Relaxation:<br></b>

Allow your forehead to rest on the mat, and let your neck relax. If your forehead doesn't touch the mat, you can place a yoga block, a folded blanket, or a cushion under your forehead for support.<br>
<b>Breathing:<br></b>

Breathe deeply and slowly. Focus on inhaling and exhaling, allowing your breath to bring a sense of calm and relaxation.<br>
<b>Lengthening the Spine:<br></b>

Lengthen your spine by reaching your tailbone toward your heels and stretching your arms forward. This gentle stretch helps release tension in the lower back.<br>
<b>Hold the Pose:<br></b>

Hold Child's Pose for as long as feels comfortable, usually anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. It can be used as a resting pose between more challenging asanas.<br>
<b>Exiting the Pose:<br></b>

To come out of Child's Pose, gently walk your hands back toward your body, lifting your torso upright. You can return to a tabletop position or transition into the next pose in your sequence.<br><center>
