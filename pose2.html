<b>Starting Position:<br></b>

Begin in a standing position at the top of your mat, with your feet together and arms at your sides.<br>
<b>Step Back:<br></b>

Take a step back with your right foot, keeping your left foot forward. The distance between your feet should be about the length of one of your own leg.<br>
<b>Foot Alignment:<br></b>

Turn your right foot to a 45-degree angle, so the outer edge of your right foot is parallel with the back edge of your mat. Your left foot should be pointing directly forward<br>.
<b>Hip Alignment:<br></b>

Square your hips to the front of the mat. This may require some adjustment of your back foot to achieve proper alignment.<br>
<b>Bend the Front Knee:<br></b>

Bend your left knee, bringing it directly over your left ankle. Aim for a 90-degree angle in the left knee, but make sure it feels comfortable and does not go past your ankle.<br>
<b>Leg Position:<br></b>

Ground down through the outer edge of your back foot, pressing it firmly into the mat. Your back leg should be straight, with a slight external rotation.<br>
<b>Torso Upright:<br></b>

Lift your torso upright and extend your arms overhead, bringing your palms together in a prayer position (Anjali Mudra). Your arms can be parallel or slightly separated, depending on your shoulder flexibility.<br>
<b>Gaze:<br></b>

Look forward or slightly upward, keeping your neck in a neutral position.<br>
<b>Shoulder Position:<br></b>

Relax your shoulders away from your ears and engage your core muscles to stabilize your torso.<br>
<b>Hold the Pose:<br></b>

Hold Warrior 1 for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply and maintaining a steady focus.<br>
<b>Transitioning Out:<br></b>

To release the pose, straighten your left leg, lower your arms, and step your right foot forward to return to the starting position.<br>
<b>Repeat on the Other Side:<br></b>

Repeat the sequence with your right foot forward and left foot back to balance the pose on both sides.<br><center>
